# i32 and u32 Vectors
Cgtools provides access to vector types listed below, but math operations are available only for `f32` and `f64`.
Math operations need to be implemented for `i32`, `i64`, `u32`, `u64`
```rust

  /// A 3-dimensional vector of `f32`s.
  pub type F32x3 = Vector< f32, 3 >;
  /// A 4-dimensional vector of `f32`s.
  pub type F32x4 = Vector< f32, 4 >;
  /// A 1-dimensional vector of `f64`s.

  /// A 2-dimensional vector of `f64`s.
  pub type F64x2 = Vector< f64, 2 >;
