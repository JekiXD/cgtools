# Minimized WASM Build

**Keywords:** WASM, Optimization, Binary Size, WebGL2

This demo showcases techniques for minimizing WebAssembly binary size in cgtools applications. It demonstrates optimization strategies including dead code elimination, LTO, and size-focused compilation.

Small WASM binaries improve load times and user experience. This example serves as a reference for production builds requiring minimal download size.
