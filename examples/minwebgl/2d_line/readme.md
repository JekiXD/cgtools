# 2D Line Rendering

**Keywords:** 2D Graphics, Lines, WebGL2, Basic Rendering

This demo demonstrates basic 2D line rendering in WebGL2. It shows how to draw simple lines using vertex buffers and basic shaders, forming the foundation for more complex 2D graphics.

This example is ideal for beginners learning WebGL2 fundamentals, covering vertex attribute setup, buffer management, and the minimal shader pipeline required for 2D line rendering. It provides a stepping stone to understanding more advanced rendering techniques.
