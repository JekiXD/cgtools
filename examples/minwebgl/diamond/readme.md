# Diamond Rendering

**Keywords:** Geometry, 3D Models, WebGL2, Materials

This demo demonstrates rendering a diamond or crystal-like object in WebGL2. It showcases advanced material properties including refraction, reflection, and caustics to create realistic gemstone appearance.

This example illustrates complex lighting calculations and material systems needed for rendering transparent, refractive objects with internal reflections.
