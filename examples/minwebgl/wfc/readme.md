# Wave Function Collapse

**Keywords:** Procedural Generation, WFC, Algorithm, WebGL2

This demo demonstrates the Wave Function Collapse algorithm for procedural content generation in WebGL2. WFC creates coherent patterns by propagating local constraints, useful for generating tile-based levels, textures, or structures.

WFC produces varied yet consistent results from small rule sets. This example shows practical implementation for game level generation or pattern synthesis.
