# Deferred Shading

**Keywords:** Deferred Rendering, G-Buffer, WebGL2, Lighting

An advanced WebGL rendering demo showcasing deferred shading techniques with volumetric light optimization. Features real-time lighting of complex scenes with numerous dynamic light sources while maintaining smooth 60fps performance.

This technique is essential for modern game engines and complex lighting scenarios. The example showcases G-buffer setup, light volume rendering, and accumulation passes for realistic multi-light scenes.
