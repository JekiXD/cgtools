![alt text](showcase.png)

## Physically-based shading with realistic, real-time rectangular area lights using Linearly Transformed Cosines (LTCs)

This demo showcases a cutting-edge, real-time rendering system that accurately simulates rectangular area light sources. It leverages the power of Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) and a novel technique called Linearly Transformed Cosines (LTCs) to produce realistic specular highlights that change shape based on the viewing angle.

## Features

### Superior Lighting Quality

- **Physically-Based Shading** - Uses the GGX microfacet model for realistic material appearance.
- **Rectangular Area Lights** - Moves beyond simplistic point lights to simulate realistic light sources with physical dimensions.
- **Soft Specular Highlights** - Specular reflections accurately stretch and change shape depending on the surface roughness and viewing angle.
- **Energy Conservation** - The lighting model correctly conserves energy, preventing objects from reflecting more light than they receive.

### Technical Advantages

- **Linearly Transformed Cosines (LTCs)** - A powerful technique that allows for the complex area light integral to be solved analytically and in real-time.
- **Precomputed Look-Up Tables (LUTs)** - Utilizes two small textures to store precomputed data for the LTC matrix and magnitude, enabling high performance on the GPU.
- **GPU Accelerated** - All complex lighting calculations are performed efficiently in the fragment shader.
- **Rust + WebAssembly** - Built with Rust and compiled to high-performance WebAssembly for native speed in the browser.

### Interactive Features

- **Dynamic Camera** - Orbit, pan, and zoom the camera to view the scene from any angle.
- **Transformable Light** - Move the area light within the scene to see the lighting and shadows update instantly.

## Quick Start

## ðŸ”§ Technical Deep Dive

### The Challenge of Area Lights

Traditional real-time rendering uses point lights, which are a simplification. Real-world light sources have a physical shape, which results in soft shadows and varied specular highlights. Accurately calculating the contribution of every point on an area light's surface for every shaded pixel requires solving a complex integral, which is typically too slow for real-time applications.

### Linearly Transformed Cosines (LTCs)

This demo uses a groundbreaking technique called **Linearly Transformed Cosines (LTCs)** to solve this problem. The core idea is to approximate the complex Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) with a simpler distribution that can be analytically integrated.

1. **Simple Starting Point**: The process begins with a simple, easy-to-integrate clamped cosine distribution.
2. **Linear Transformation**: A 3x3 matrix is used to linearly transform this simple cosine shape, stretching and skewing it to closely match the appearance of a GGX microfacet BRDF lobe for a given material roughness and viewing angle.
3. **Analytic Integration**: Because of the properties of linear transformations, integrating the complex, transformed distribution over the area of the light is equivalent to integrating the simple cosine distribution over a transformed version of the light polygon. This new integral has a known analytical solution, which can be calculated very quickly on the GPU.

This entire process is made efficient by pre-calculating the transformation matrices for various roughness values and view angles and storing them in a small look-up texture.
