# Area Light Rendering

**Keywords:** Lighting, Area Lights, WebGL2, Realistic Shading

This demo demonstrates area light implementation in WebGL2. Unlike point lights, area lights have physical dimensions, producing more realistic soft shadows and lighting that better mimics real-world light sources like windows or light panels.

Area lighting is essential for photorealistic rendering, providing natural-looking illumination with soft penumbras. This example shows practical techniques for approximating area light contributions efficiently in real-time applications.
