# Sprite Animation

**Keywords:** Sprites, 2D Animation, WebGL2, Textures

This demo demonstrates sprite sheet animation in WebGL2. It shows how to efficiently animate 2D characters or effects using texture atlases and UV coordinate manipulation.

Sprite animation is fundamental for 2D games and UI effects. This example provides an efficient implementation using GPU texture sampling.
