# Uniform Animation

**Keywords:** Uniforms, Animation, WebGL2, Shaders

This demo demonstrates animating shader uniforms in WebGL2. It shows how to pass time-varying data to shaders, enabling dynamic effects without modifying geometry.

Uniform animation is efficient for procedural effects like pulsing colors, moving patterns, or time-based distortions. This example illustrates proper uniform management and update strategies.
