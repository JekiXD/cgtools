# Cube Map Generation

**Keywords:** Cube Maps, Environment Mapping, WebGL2, Skybox

This demo demonstrates cube map generation and usage in WebGL2. Cube maps are essential for environment reflections, skyboxes, and image-based lighting, providing 360-degree environmental information. It's fundamental for PBR workflows and atmospheric rendering.

This example shows how to create, load, and sample cube maps.
