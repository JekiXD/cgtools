# Simple PBR

**Keywords:** PBR, Materials, WebGL2, Lighting

This demo demonstrates a simplified physically-based rendering implementation in WebGL2. It introduces PBR concepts with a minimal, educational approach focusing on core metallic-roughness workflow.

Simple PBR provides realistic materials without full complexity. This example is ideal for learning PBR fundamentals before tackling complete implementations.
