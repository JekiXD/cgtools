# Raycaster

**Keywords:** Ray Casting, Collision, WebGL2, Interaction

This demo demonstrates ray casting for 3D scene interaction in WebGL2. Ray casting converts 2D screen coordinates to 3D rays, enabling precise object selection, collision detection, and physics interactions.

Ray casting is fundamental for 3D user interfaces and game mechanics. This example provides a reusable implementation for mouse-based 3D interaction.
