## Filter applier

To load an image put it into `resources` folder, and then supply its name into `image_path` variable.

``` rust
let image_path = "static/image.png";
```

Then run `trunk serve` or `trunk serve --release`. Filters are made with inspiration from http://www.arahaya.com/imagefilters/. To save the image you can right click and press 'save image as'.
