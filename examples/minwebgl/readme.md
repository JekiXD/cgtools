# ðŸ”¬ WebGL Examples with `minwebgl`

Welcome to the `minwebgl` examples directory! This collection showcases a wide variety of WebGL rendering techniques, from fundamental concepts to advanced graphics pipelines, all implemented in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly.

Each example is a self-contained project designed to demonstrate a specific feature, algorithm, or use case, making this a valuable resource for learning modern, high-performance web graphics with Rust.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Examples

All examples are built using Rust and the `trunk` build tool to simplify the WebAssembly development workflow.

### Prerequisites

1. **Rust**: Ensure you have a recent version of the Rust toolchain installed. You can get it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
2. **Wasm Target**: Add the WebAssembly target to your Rust toolchain:

    ```bash
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    ```

3. **Trunk**: Install the `trunk` build tool, which handles Wasm compilation, asset management, and serving.

    ```bash
    cargo install trunk
    ```

### Running a Specific Example

To run any of the examples, navigate to its directory and use the `trunk serve` command. For best performance, always use `--release` mode.

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the desired example's directory
cd examples/minwebgl/<example_name>

# 2. Build and serve the application in release mode
trunk serve --release

# 3. Open your browser to the provided address (usually http://127.0.0.1:8080)
```

For example, to run the `gltf_viewer` demo:

```bash
cd examples/minwebgl/gltf_viewer
trunk serve --release
```
